							<p>BLÜB is an interactive participatory game that enhances the user experience behind social gaming. Our purpose with this project is to create a whole new way of playing with one another as well as enabling more interaction between real life people. A lot of individuals spend too much time playing video/online games behind a computer, without communicating with others around them. Our game will drive users to communicate with others in order to create a team and win the game. Essentially, it is an interactive game where 2 teams compete against each other. In a room, we find 2 wooden bases placed at opposite sides, where each team has to align behind their corresponding base in order to start the game. The game itself is projected on the floor of that room. It consists of a trajectory made up of shapes, where the start and end of the trajectory are the two bases. In other words, the bases are connected through the trajectory. Each team starts by sending one individual to run along the trajectory by jumping into each shape, trying to make their way to their opposite base. However, when the two individuals collide while on the trajectory, they face a challenge to determine who continues the path, and who restarts from the beginning. The winner is the first team to reach their opposite base. The project will be completed for the end of the Winter Semester 2020.</p>
							<p>BLÜB will use a projector as its way of displaying the game. The projector will be attached to a ceiling grid with the help of an arm grip. As for how the actual game is made, there are 3 main parts to creating it. The first is the programming, done in the back end, for the game to actually work. We will be using Node.js to code the game’s interactivity and reactivity to the user’s actions, as well as the design of the game. The floor color projection will be black, while the shapes creating the trajectory will be of different colors, almost glowing in the dark for the user to see everything clearly. The second part is electronics. Each team will start the game with their first team member holding a stick that they will always have to have in hand. Even if they fail a challenge, they have to give their stick to the next member from their team on their way back. This stick will have a distance sensor that will enable the “scanning” of the stick with the base, once the user reaches the other team’s base. This distance sensor (stick & base) will be achieved using particles photons. Node.js will thus work with this sensor by detecting the scan and cause something to happen to the game. The last part is the physical aspect of BLÜB. We are talking about the construction of each of the team’s bases. These bases will be the two extremities of every trajectory possible in the game. Each team will start at a base and line up beside/behind it, waiting for their turn to jump in the trajectory. These bases will be made of wood and will resemble a small podium. On each wooden base, there will be the electronics necessary to scan the stick at the end of each game. Together, these three components will enable us to create our interactive game. </p>
