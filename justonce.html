							<p>Opioids use disorder (OUD) represents a worldwide health and societal burden. More recently, an “opioid epidemic” has emerged in North America: over prescription of opioids painkillers has led to a rise in overdose deaths at alarming rates, with more than 70 thousands deaths worldwide last year. Even if addiction and opioids use have been depicted in numerous art pieces, through music or videos, the conception that addiction is a mental health disorder is not grounded in common knowledge. Moreover, the scientific definition of addiction, the precise addiction cycle described both in clinic and fundamental research, as well as the theory of “the dark side of addiction” remains mainly ignored by the public. In our project, we would like to participate in the dissemination of a more accurate vision of addiction, of the slow and insidious progression of the disease. How could we break the stigma stick around substance use disorders? Could we move the perception of addiction from a failure of willpower to a mental health disorder? Can we speak out for harm reduction to help fight the current raging opioid crisis? Only Once is an interactive installation that aims at making the viewer experience the full cycle of OUD, from the light euphoria of the first consumption to the deep darkness of opioids withdrawal. </p>
							<p>This project is launched as a part of the CONVERGENCE initiative, a course given at Concordia University. It aims at gathering artists and neuroscientists for them to exchange and learn from each other. We decided to create a piece of art that tackles a subject that has meaning and touches our feelings, while fostering constructive dialog. As the recent opioid crisis placed opioid overdose as the first cause of premature deaths in North America (above car accidents), we believe it is an important subject that is worth speaking out. We also believe that scientific communications initiatives around opioids could prevent a lot of damage. Through our project, we hope to convey the notion that drug addiction is a chronic relapsing brain disorder, characterized by a cycle of preoccupation/anticipation, binge/intoxication, and withdrawal/negative affect. We plan to mimic these different stages using light and sounds, to embody the insidious process that leads to OUD. To do so, we plan to build a metallic structure that will hold an hourglass filled with white powder. The viewer will be able to interact and turn the hourglass. Each rotation of the hourglass will simulate one consumption of opioids, then triggering a combination of sounds and lights. Together, the sound and the light intensity will embody the feelings and sensations one can have while consuming an opioid. They will match the different stages of OUDs . At the first consumption - here the first rotation of the hourglass - the light and sound will be soft and smooth, embodying the light feelings described by opium smokers or heroin users. But rapidly, with the progression of the hourglass turns (each new rotation), the pleasant light and sounds will gradually fade away, until producing strident sounds and dim light.  It will represent the intense physical discomfort and despair feelings accompanying the withdrawal from opioids. The experience will end up by a final overdose, as indicated by suffocating sounds - just as a real opioid overdose produces a fatal respiratory depression. The whole experience will end up  in total darkness and silence.

On a technical side, the hourglass will be designed to match the time of each stage. The turns of the hourglass will be monitored with a tilt switch and solenoids. It will then be mapped to the different stages of opioid addiction illustrated by the lights and sound effects. The lights will be controlled with Node.js and the Particle Photon microcontroller. The sounds will be produced using the Audition software sound mixer.
